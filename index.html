                    </p>
                    <p>China Central Television (CCTV) reported on several common tricks used by these agencies. Some lie about their certification, what they could do for their customers ability and the situation overseas to unknowing clients. They would pocket the customers’ money,  shirk their responsibilities when caught. 
                    </p>
                    <p>“These institution and individuals took advantage of Chinese parents’ aspirations for their children and their blind trust on foreign-related companies, in order to make profit unethically and organize illegal activities,” said <a href="http://www.cctv.com/abroad/special/C11007/20030928/100790.shtml">the report</a>.
                    </p>
                     <p>In response, the Ministry of Education launched the website of Foreign - related Education Information Supervision Network (<a href="http://www.jsj.edu.cn/", target="_blank">FE Network</a>) on 2003. The network lists of legal foreign education institutions and study-abroad agencies that have gained the recognition of the Chinese government.
                    </p>
                     <p>The website also publishes national policies updates, important events and notifications related to foreign education.
                    </p>
                     <p>Every study-abroad related agency in the country needs to submit annual report about its business situation and future plans to local education and policy departments. 
                    </p>
                     <p>Failing to do so or if the report is problematic, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce has the right to force the agencies to rectify and reform until they meet the requirements.
                    </p>
                     <p>Improved regulations and policies plus a rising middle class in China have meant more and more students are able to study overseas.This, in turn, led to increasing competition to get into good schools.
                    </p>
                     <p>Some agencies try to convince students that they should first study so-called preparatory courses in the countries they wanted to go to before applying to universities. 
                    </p>
                     <p>“Some classmates of mine chose to study at community colleges first in the U.S., then apply to other universities after that,” said Shan Tongxun, a girl from Beijing who is now studying in New York.
                    </p>
                    <p>But some students soon realise that shelling out a lot of money to the agencies was no guarantee for places at top universities. 
                    </p>
                    <p>“There are tough criteria such as high scores in the SAT and other academic evaluation,” said Shan.
                    </p>
                    <p>Coco Ren, a school mate of Shan in Beijing, agreed.“Some hard working students do end up in good universities after community college,” Coco said.
                    </p>
                    <p>Some though are misguided in the approach to getting an oversea education. In some cases, the diplomas they were awarded turned out to be fake, or invalid.

                  <p>Tang Jun, for example, became notorious in 2010. He was the founder of a consultant company who claimed to have worked for some big companies such as MicroSoft. Tang was accused of lying about going to had The California Institute of Technology in his book by Fang Zhouzi, a scientific writer who is well known for his campaigns against various pseudoscience and fraud in China.
                  </p>
                  <p>Also, the school where he gained his doctorate degree, Pacific Western University (now California Miramar University), was a “diploma mill” that’s not qualified to issue doctorates.
                  </p>
                  <p>According to Chicago Sun-Times, Pacific Western University’s license was suspended between 1994 to 1996, yet Tang claimed that he gained the degree in 1995.

                   <p>Tang and the authenticity of his diplomas stirred a heated debate. In 2011, Tang admitted in an interview that he bought a diploma from Pacific Western University for $3000 U.S.
                   </p>
                   <p>“That was because I felt shameful that I didn’t have a doctorate degree,” said Tang in the <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/it/2011-04/12/c_121296323.htm", target="_blank">interview</a>, “I have to say it was out of vanity.”     
                   </p>
                   <p>The scandal of Tang Jun’s fake diploma rang alarm bells for these diploma mills. The Ministry of Education then published a list of unqualified universities which  study-abroad agencies tried to cheat their customers into attending.

                    <p>In recent decades, the number of Chinese students who wish to study abroad has exploded. This, in turn, created business opportunities. English education institutions, visa helper centers and later study-abroad agencies, which act as one stop shops for students who want to go overseas, are now all over China
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1978, when the Chinese government began Reform and Opening up, the 40-years’ break of Chinese education due to war and political instability was finally ended, families who could afford it, tried every which way to send their children abroad. The patriarch leader, Deng Xiaoping, expanded the quota of students who could go overseas from “around ten”, to “hundreds and thousands” (<a href="http://www.chinatimes.com/newspapers/20170423000735-260306", target="_blank">要成千上萬地派，不是只派十個八個</a>"). 
                    </p>
                    <p>In 1980, China began to grant approval for self-funded students to study abroad. Those seeking a foreign education increased ten times between 1983 and 1986, said a documentary about the history of oversea education done by Phoenix TV. Only one year later by 1987, 100 thousand Chinese students went abroad for education. 
                    </p>
                    <p>According to Prof.Wang’s analysis, over 220 thousands student went to over 100 different countries and regions for education during 1978 to 2000, covered almost every science and social science majors.
                    </p>
                    <p>In late 1980s and early 1990s, many institutions opened up to prepare students for life outside China. Not only did they provide English classes, they also arranged applications to schools and universities overseas and helped with visa preparation. New Oriental Education, the biggest English education institution in China today with more than 67 branch offices now, was founded at that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>A major obstacle for Chinese students in that period was a lack of access to  information on education institutions overseas. They didn’t know how to apply nor did they know what would happen once they went abroad.
                    </p>
                    <p>Agents, consultants and so-called “foreign ambassadors” then appeared. They worked for English education companies and helped to sort out applications for the students.  
                    </p>
                    <p>The lack of regulation on how these companies and agents operate led to cases of fraud and exploitation of families who aspired for a better future for their children.

                    <p>Yun Jiang (not her real name) was a high school student at Beijing. One day in 2003, she saw an advertisement for a China Education Service Center” (CESC) in a newspaper. It offered  services for students who wanted to go to university in Germany. 
                    </p>
                    <p>Yun thought her dream of going overseas would come true, but it turned out to be a nightmare.
                    </p>
                    <p>That October, Yun’s father and her signed a contract with CESC and paid 15,000 RMB. The institution promised that after a one-year language course, and if Yun could pass the test, she could be admitted to a public university in Germany.
                    </p>
                    <p>The family then paid another 12,200 Euros, approximately 90,000 RMB. That was supposed to include all the tuition, processing fees, accommodation and other course charges, Yun and four other students from Beijing signed similar contracts with CESC. They arrived in Augsburg, Germany, in February 2004.
                    </p>
                    <p>Ten months’ study later, the four students received a notification from the Germany language school in Augsburg, saying that the school had not received their tuition fees since October, 2004. They also found that of the ten months’ worth of insurance fee they paid through CESC, only one month’s was actually paid to the German school.
                    </p>
                    <p>The parents contacted CESC manager, Li Jingyan. Li told them that CESC would fix the problem. But that never happened.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to keep their visas, the four students had no choice but to pay the rest of the fees themselves.
                    </p>
                    <p>A year later, Yun passed the language test.
                    </p>
                    <p>But CESC never helped her to apply to the university she wanted to go. Yun then started to apply to a  private school herself. Her father then found out that Chinese high school students were not allowed to apply for public universities in Germany without a qualified preparation course’s diploma. It was only then that they realisd CESC had been lying to them.
                    </p>
                    <p>Yun’s family then filed a fraud claim against CESC.
                    </p>
                    <p>In an email, CESC told JingHua Newspaper that the manager Li Jingyan, had colluded with a man named Yang Zheng. They apparently pocketed the money.  The company, the email said, had never hired Yang Zheng. They claimed they had already fired Li by the time they received the claim.
                    </p>
                    <p>The email also pointed out that Yun and other students’ parents were responsible too because they didn’t follow the contract to give the money directly to the company.  Instead they paid Li.
                    </p>
                    <p>“The company can’t supervise the actions of every employee everyday,” CESC said in the reply, “it’s very likely that they took the money for themselves”.
                    </p>
                    <p>CESC was founded on 1984 by the National Education Commission of the People’s Republic of China as one of four official institutions that dealt with study-abroad affairs. But it changed into a limited company in 2001. In 2005, CESC’s publications still claimed that it was operating under the Ministry of Education. In 2009, the Ministry of Education stated on their official website that “although it has the title of ‘China education’, CESC did not belong to the ministry in any form.”

                  <p>Yun told JingHua Newspaper in 2005 that she was frustrated, anxious and busy. A preparatory entrance test for the private school she was interested in might be cancelled because not enough students had registered.
                  </p>
                  <p>She rented a place with several other people and could only afford one meal a day: “It’s very expensive here,” said Yun.
                  </p>
                  <p>Little did Yun know that she was just one of many victims of fraudulent study-abroad agencies, similar things happened to another kid that was reported by the Ministry of Education as a warning case.
                  </p>
                  <p>Due to low information accessibility and transparency, the same trick of language school, preparatory courses and public university that some agencies played had hoodwinked a lot of Chinese high school students in the early 2000s, as recorded by the Ministry of Education.

                   <p>According to the Ministry of Education, one student was cheated out of more than 10,000 RMB in expenses and 15,000 RMB in agency fees. He spent three years studying at a language center in Köln,Germany.  The student, who wanted to remain anonymous, was settled in a house that was remote from the city. 
                   </p>
                   <p>His teachers were immigrants from the former Soviet Union and not native German speakers. For three years, the agency kept changing its claim of what it could do for the student’s study plan and his visa arrangement.
                   </p>
                   <p>He was initially promised that he would share an apartment with only one other person, get a German language qualification, have the chance of being admitted into a German university. None of it came true. 
                   </p>
                   <p>A certain Mr. Xu, the so-called “Chief of Student Union” in Germany showed up at the language school, forced the students to sign contracts with language center without mutually agreement on the payment and intrigued new students to buy expensive traffic plans to get kickback from the traffic companies.

                    <p>In April 2017, CESC’s website still claimed that it “originally belong to the Ministry of Education”. The website though had not been  updated for ten years.

                  <p>According to the Ministry of Education’s study-abroad information website, CESC’s was still on the list of licensed agencies that are qualified to deal with study-abroad business, not as what they claimed on the their website, that it was expired by 2010.  
                  </p>
                  <p>The site directs users to the advertisement page of another education agency, <i>earthedu.com</i>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>This new agency shared the same address and business license as CESC, except  the liable party named in the licence was “China Center for International Information Exchange” or <i>“Eastday.com study-aboard”</i>. Clicking around, the website turned out to be an advertisement of another agency: <i>study-abroad 360</i>.  
                  </p>
                  <p>At the same time, CESE’s Baidu page claims that the agency has been working with yet another a study-abroad website: <i>juesheng.com</i> since 2012.

                <div class="col-md-8 col-sm-6"> 
                   <p>The Baidu page also states that CESC has a group of education consultants, several of whom, it says, are senior government officers and university professors. The identities of these individuals could be confirmed on the official websites of the institutions they belonged, but there is no proof of the links with CESC.
                   </p>
                   <p>As for <i>juesheng.com</i>, it is introduced as an organization to organization education gateway.
                   </p>
                   <p>Moreover, several institutions that claimed to be CESC’s sub-companies in Yangzhou, Wuhan and other Chinese cities continue to hold conferences and sharing sessions on studying overseas. They share the same logo claiming their links to the Ministry of Education, on their websites.
